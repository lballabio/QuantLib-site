<div class="textblock"><p ><b>Release 1.25 - January 2022</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li><b>End of support:</b> this release and the next will be the last two to support Visual Studio 2013.</li>
<li>Added a few CMake presets for building the library (thanks to Jonathan Sweemer).</li>
<li>When built and installed through CMake, the library now installs a <code>QuantLibConfig.cmake</code> file that allows other CMake projects to find and use <a class="el" href="namespace_quant_lib.html">QuantLib</a> (thanks to Jonathan Sweemer).</li>
</ul>
<p >CASHFLOWS</p><ul>
<li>Fixed the accrual calculation in overnight-indexed coupons (thanks to Mohammad Shojatalab).</li>
<li>Fixed fixing-days usage in <code>SubPeriodsCoupon</code> class (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).</li>
<li>IBOR coupons fixed in the past no longer need a forecast curve to return their amount.</li>
</ul>
<p >INDEXES</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Important change:</b> inflation indexes inherited from the <code>ZeroInflationIndex</code> class no longer rely on their forecast curve for interpolation. For coupons that already took care of interpolation (as in the case of <code>CPICoupon</code> and <code>ZeroInflationCashFlow</code>) this should not change the results. In other cases, figures will change but should be more correct as the interpolation is now performed according to market conventions. Also, most inflation curves now assume that the index is not implemented. Year-on-year inflation indexes and curves are not affected.</li>
</ul>
<p >INSTRUMENTS</p><ul>
<li><b>Breaking change:</b> convertible bonds were moved out of the <code>ql/experimental</code> folder. Also, being market values and not part of the contract, dividends and credit spread were moved from the bond to the <code>BinomialConvertibleEngine</code> class (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).</li>
<li>The <code>ForwardRateAgreement</code> no longer inherits from <code>Forward</code>. This also made it possible to implement the <code>amount</code> method returning the expected cash settlement (thanks to Lew Wei Hao). The methods from <code>Forward</code> were kept available but deprecated so code using them won't break. Client code might break if it performed casts to <code>Forward</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p >MODELS</p><ul>
<li>Fixed formula for discount bond option in CIR++ model (thanks to Magnus Mencke).</li>
</ul>
<p >TERM STRUCTURES</p><ul>
<li>It is now possible to use normal volatilities in SABR smile sections, and thus in the <code>SwaptionVolCube1</code> class (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).</li>
</ul>
<p >DATE/TIME</p><ul>
<li>Added Chinese holidays for 2022 (thanks to Cheng Li).</li>
</ul>
<p >CURRENCIES</p><ul>
<li>Added a number of African, American, Asian and European currencies from Quaternion's <code>QuantExt</code> project (thanks to Ole Bueker).</li>
</ul>
<p >EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER</p>
<p >The <code>ql/experimental</code> folder contains code whose interface is not fully stable, but is released in order to get user feedback. Experimental classes make no guarantees of backward compatibility; their interfaces might change in future releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added experimental rate helpers for LIBOR-LIBOR and Overnight-LIBOR basis swaps.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>WulinYongDoubleBarrierEngine</code> to <code>SuoWangDoubleBarrierEngine</code> (thanks to Adityakumar Sinha for the fix and Ruilong Xu for the heads-up).</li>
</ul>
<p >DEPRECATED FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>Deprecated the constructors of zero-coupon inflation term structures taking an <code>indexIsInterpolated</code> boolean argument.</li>
<li>Deprecated a number of methods in the <code>ForwardRateAgreement</code> class that used to be inherited from <code>Forward</code>.</li>
<li>Deprecated a couple of constructors in the <code>SofrFutureRateHelper</code> class.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>WulinYongDoubleBarrierEngine</code> alias for <code>SuoWangDoubleBarrierEngine</code>.</li>
<li>Deprecated the protected <code>spreadLegValue_</code> data member in the <code>BlackIborCouponPricer</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<p >Thanks go also to Tom Anderson, Francois Botha, Matthew Kolbe, Benson Luk, Marcin Rybacki, Henning Segger, Klaus Spanderen, and GitHub users jxcv0 and azsrz for smaller fixes, enhancements and bug reports.</p>
<p ><b>Release 1.24 - October 2021</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>Overhauled the CMake build system (thanks to Philip Kovacs). Among other things, it now allows to specify the available configuration options from the <code>cmake</code> invocation and adds the required Boost libraries accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p >INSTRUMENTS</p><ul>
<li>Avoid callable-bond mispricing when a call date is close but not equal to a coupon date (thanks to Ralf Konrad for the fix and to GitHub user aichao for the analysis). See <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/issues/930">https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/issues/930</a> for details.</li>
<li>A new <code>RiskyBondEngine</code> is available for bonds (thanks to Lew Wei Hao). It prices bonds based on a risk-free discount cure and a default-probability curve used to assess the probability of each coupon payment. It makes accessible to all bonds the calculations previously available in the experimental <code>RiskyBond</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<p >CASHFLOWS</p><ul>
<li>The choice between par and indexed coupons was moved to <code>IborCouponPricer</code> (thanks to Peter Caspers). This also made it possible to override the choice locally when building a <code>VanillaSwap</code> or a <code>SwapRateHelper</code>, so that coupons with both behaviors can now be used at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p >TERM STRUCTURES</p><ul>
<li>Cross-currency basis swap rate helpers now support both constant-notional and marked-to-market swaps (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).</li>
</ul>
<p >DATE/TIME</p><ul>
<li>Added Chilean calendar (thanks to Anubhav Pandey).</li>
<li>Added new <code>ThirdWednesdayInclusive</code> date-generation rule that also adjusts start and end dates (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).</li>
</ul>
<p >PATTERNS</p><ul>
<li>Overhauled <code>Singleton</code> implementation (thanks to Peter Caspers). Singletons are now initialized in a thread-safe way when sessions are enabled, global singletons (that is, independent of sessions) were made available, and static initialization was made safer.</li>
</ul>
<p >TEST SUITE</p><ul>
<li>Sped up some of the longer-running tests (thanks to Mohammad Shojatalab).</li>
</ul>
<p >DEPRECATED FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>Deprecated default constructor for the U.S. calendar; the desired market should now be passed explicitly.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>nominalTermStructure</code> method and the corresponding data member in inflation term structures. Any object needing the nominal term structure should have it passed explicitly.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>termStructure_</code> data member in <code>BlackCalibrationHelper</code>. It you're inheriting from <code>BlackCalibrationHelper</code> and need it, declare it in your derived class.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>createAtParCoupons</code>, <code>createIndexedCoupons</code> and <code>usingAtParCoupons</code> methods of <code>IborCoupon</code>, now moved to a new <code>IborCoupon::Settings</code> singleton (thanks to Philip Kovacs).</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>conversionType</code> and <code>baseCurrency</code> static data members of <code>Money</code>, now moved to a new <code>Money::Settings</code> singleton (thanks to Philip Kovacs).</li>
<li>Removed features deprecated in version 1.19: the <code>BMAIndex</code> constructor taking a calendar, the <code>AmericanCondition</code> and <code>ShoutCondition</code> constructors taking an option type and strike, the <code>CurveDependentStepCondition</code> class and the <code>StandardCurveDependentStepCondition</code> typedef, the <code>BlackCalibrationHelper</code> constructor taking a yield term structure, the various inflation term structure constructors taking a yield term structure, the various yield term constructors taking a vector of jumps but not specifying a reference date.</li>
</ul>
<p >Thanks go also to Mickael Anas Laaouini, Jack Gillett, Bojan Nikolic and Klaus Spanderen for smaller fixes, enhancements and bug reports.</p>
<p ><b>Release 1.23 - July 14th, 2021</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>On Mac OS, the <code>-std=c++11</code> flag is now added automatically when needed. This applies to both <code>configure</code> and <code>cmake</code> (thanks to Leander Schulten).</li>
<li>We now assume that the compiler supports Boost::uBLAS and no longer check for it in configure. (The check was originally introduced for versions of gcc before 4.x, which don't support C++ anyway.) Please let us know if this causes problems on some systems.</li>
<li>The <code>Period</code>, <code>InterestRate</code> and <code>InterestRateIndex</code> classes are now visualized more clearly in the Visual Studio debugger (thanks to Francois Botha).</li>
</ul>
<p >CASHFLOWS</p><ul>
<li>Year-on-year and CPI legs are now set a default coupon pricer. In most cases, this removes the need for setting it explicitly.</li>
<li>Add new <code>ZeroInflationCashFlow</code> class, used in zero-coupon inflation swaps (thanks to Ralf Konrad).</li>
</ul>
<p >CURRENCIES</p><ul>
<li>Added custom constructor that allows to create bespoke currencies not already included in the library (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).</li>
</ul>
<p >DATE/TIME</p><ul>
<li>Fixed implementation of U.S. 30/360 convention (the old one is still available as 30/360 NASD).</li>
<li>The 30/360 ISDA convention can now take the termination date as a constructor argument and use it to adjust the calculation properly.</li>
<li>Added the 30/360 ISMA convention; the Bond-Basis convention is now an alias to the former.</li>
<li>The 30/360 German convention was renamed to ISDA; "German" remains as an alias.</li>
<li>Added new Canadian holiday (National Day for Truth and Reconciliation) established in 2021 (thanks to GitHub user <code>qiubill</code> for the heads-up).</li>
<li>Added new U.S. holiday (Juneteenth) established in 2021.</li>
<li>Added new Platinum Jubilee U.K. holiday for 2022 (thanks to Ioannis Rigopoulos for the heads-up.)</li>
<li>Added missing Christmas Eve holiday to Norwegian calendar (thanks to Prince Nanda).</li>
</ul>
<p >INDEXES</p><ul>
<li>Added ESTR index (thanks to Magnus Mencke).</li>
</ul>
<p >INSTRUMENTS</p><ul>
<li>Added zero-coupon swap (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).</li>
<li>The <code>Type</code> enumeration defined in several swap classes was moved to their base <code>Swap</code> class.</li>
<li>Fixed sign of theta in experimental Kirk engine for spread options (thanks to Xu Ruilong for the heads-up).</li>
</ul>
<p >PROCESSES</p><ul>
<li>Improved discretization of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process to avoid occasional divergence (thanks to Magnus Mencke).</li>
</ul>
<p >DEPRECATED FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>Deprecated default constructor for actual/actual and 30/360 day counters; the desired convention should now be passed explicitly.</li>
<li>Removed features deprecated in version 1.18: the <code>CalibrationHelperBase</code> typedef (now <code>CalibrationHelper</code>), some overloads of the <code>CalibratedModel::calibrate</code> and <code>CalibratedModel::value</code> methods, the constructors of <code>PiecewiseYieldCurve</code> and <code>PiecewiseDefaultCurve</code> taking an <code>accuracy</code> parameter, the constructors of <code>BondHelper</code>, <code>FixedRateBondHelper</code> and <code>CPIBondHelper</code> taking a boolean <code>useCleanPrice</code> parameter, the <code>BondHelper::useCleanPrice()</code> method, and the non-static <code>Calendar::holidayList</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p >Thanks go also to Francis Duffy, Kevin Kirchhoff, Magnus Mencke and Klaus Spanderen for smaller fixes, enhancements and bug reports.</p>
<p ><b>Release 1.22 - April 15th, 2021</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>As previously announced, this release drops support for Visual C++ 2012. VC++ 2013 or later is now required.</li>
<li>The <code>Date</code> and <code>Array</code> classes are now visualized more clearly in the Visual Studio debugger (thanks to Francois Botha).</li>
</ul>
<p >LANGUAGE STANDARD</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="namespace_quant_lib.html">QuantLib</a> now uses the C++11 standard and no longer compiles in C++03 mode. As before, it can be compiled with later versions of the standard. For details on the C++11 features used, see the pull requests marked "C++11 modernization" at the above link; for information on possible problems, see <a href="https://www.implementingquantlib.com/2021/02/leaving-03-for-real.html">https://www.implementingquantlib.com/2021/02/leaving-03-for-real.html</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p ><b>Release 1.19 - July 20th, 2020</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>Support for Visual C++ 2012 is being deprecated. It will be dropped around the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 in order to enable use of C++11 features.</li>

<p >DEPRECATED FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>Features deprecate in version 1.14 were removed: one of the constructors of the <code>BSMOperator</code> class, the whole <code>OperatorFactory</code> class, and the typedef <code>CalibrationHelper</code> which was used to alias the <code>BlackCalibrationHelper</code> class.</li>
<li>The <code>CalibrationHelperBase</code> class is now called <code>CalibrationHelper</code>. The old name remains as a typedef but is deprecated.</li>
<li>The overload of <code>CalibratedModel::calibrate</code> and <code>CalibratedModel::value</code> taking a vector of <code>BlackCalibrationHelper</code>s are deprecated in favor of the ones taking a vector of <code>CalibrationHelper</code>s.</li>
<li>The static method <code>Calendar::holidayList</code> is deprecated in favor of the instance method by the same name.</li>
<li>The constructors of <code>PiecewiseDefaultCurve</code> and <code>PiecewiseYieldCurve</code> taking an accuracy parameter are deprecated in favor of passing the parameter to an instance of the bootstrap class.</li>
<li>The constructors of <code>BondHelper</code> and derived classes taking a boolean flag to choose between clean and dirty price are deprecated in favor of the ones taking a <code>Bond::Price::Type</code> argument.

</ul>
<p ><b>Release 1.17 - December 3rd, 2019</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>As of this release, support of Visual C++ 2010 is deprecated; it will be dropped in next release. Also, we'll probably deprecate Visual C++ 2012 in one of the next few releases in order to drop it around the end of 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p >CONFIGURATION</p><ul>
<li>A new function <code>compiledBoostVersion()</code> is available, (thanks to Andrew Smith). It returns the version of Boost used to compile the library, as reported by the <code>BOOST_VERSION</code> macro. This can help avoid linking the library with user code compiled with a different Boost version (which can result in erratic behavior).</li>
<li>It is now possible to specify at run time whether to use indexed coupons (thanks to Ralf Konrad). The compile-time configuration is still used as a default, but it is also possible to call either of the static methods <code>IborCoupon::createAtParCoupons</code> or <code>IborCoupon::createIndexedCoupons</code> to specify your preference. For the time being, the methods above must necessarily be called before creating any instance of <code>IborCoupon</code> or of its derived classes.</li>
</ul>
<p >BUILD</p><ul>
<li>As of this version, the names of the binaries produced by the included Visual C++ solution no longer contain the toolset version (e.g., v142).</li>
</ul>
<p >INSTRUMENTS</p><ul>
<li>Added ex-coupon functionality to floating-rate bonds (thanks to Steven Van Haren).</li>
<li>The inner structure <code>Callability::Price</code> was moved to the class <code>Bond</code> and can now be used to specify what kind of price was passed to the <code>BondFunctions::yield</code> method (thanks to Francois Botha).</li>
<li>It is now possible to use a par-coupon approximation for FRAs like the one used in Ibor coupons (thanks to Peter Caspers).</li>
</ul>
<p >PRICING ENGINES</p><ul>
<li>Added escrowed dividend model to the new-style FD engine for <code>DividendVanillaOption</code> (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).</li>
<li>Black cap/floor engine now also returns caplet deltas (thanks to Wojciech Slusarski).</li>
</ul>
<p >TERM STRUCTURES</p><ul>
<li>OIS rate helpers can now choose whether to use as a pillar for the bootstrap either their maturity date or the end date of the last underlying fixing. This provides an alternative if the bootstrap should fail. (Thanks to Drew Saunders for the heads-up.)</li>
<li>Instances of the <code>FittedBondDiscountCurve</code> class now behave as simple evaluators (that is, they use the given parameters without performing root-solving) when the <code>maxIterations</code> parameter is set to 0. (Thanks to Nick Firoozye for the heads-up.)</li>
</ul>
<p >DATE/TIME</p><ul>
<li>Added a few special closing days to the US government bond calendar (thanks to Mike DelMedico).</li>

<li>Removed typedefs GammaDistribution, ChiSquareDistribution, NonCentralChiSquareDistribution and InverseNonCentralChiSquareDistribution, deprecated in version 1.12. Use CumulativeGammaDistribution, CumulativeChiSquareDistribution, NonCentralCumulativeChiSquareDistribution and InverseNonCentralCumulativeChiSquareDistribution instead.</li>
<li>Removed Actual365NoLeap class, deprecated in version 1.11. It was folded into Actual365Fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p >TERM STRUCTURES</p><ul>
<li>Take payment days into account when calculating the nodes of a bootstrapped curve based on overnight swaps.</li>
</ul>
<p ><b>Release 1.15 - February 19th, 2019</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>This release drops support for Boost version 1.43 to 1.47; the minimum required version is now Boost 1.48, released in 2011.</li>

<li>Added multi-curve bootstrapping example (thanks to Jose Garcia). This examples supersedes the old swap-valuation example, that was therefore removed.</li>
</ul>
<p >NEW OPT-IN FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>It is now possible to use <code>std::function</code>, <code>std::bind</code> and their related classes instead of <code>boost::function</code> and <code>boost::bind</code>. The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the <code>QL_USE_STD_FUNCTION</code> macro in <code>ql/userconfig.hpp</code> on Visual C++ or by passing the <code>--enable-std-function</code> to <code>./configure</code> on other systems. This requires using at least the C++11 standard during compilation.</li>
<li>A new <code>./configure</code> switch, <code>--enable-std-classes</code>, was added as a shortcut for <code>--enable-std-pointers</code> <code>--enable-std-unique-ptr</code> <code>--enable-std-function</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p ><b>Release 1.14 - October 1st, 2018</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>In April 2018, Microsoft ended its support for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. As previously announced, this release drops support for it.</li>
<li>Fixed generation of RPM from QuantLib.spec (thanks to Simon Rees).</li>
<li>Avoided uses of some features removed in C++17 so that the library can be compiled under the latest standard if needed.</li>
<li><code>boost::shared_ptr</code> and a few related classes and functions were imported into the new namespace <code>QuantLib::ext</code>. This allows them to be conditionally replaced with their <code>std::</code> versions (see the "opt-in features" section below). The default is still to use the boost implementation. Client code using the <code>boost</code> namespace explicitly doesn't need to be updated.</li>
<li>Fixed build and tests on FreeBSD-11 (thanks to Klaus Spanderen and to Mikhail Teterin for the heads-up).</li>
<li>Fixed tests with the <code>-ffast-math</code> compilation flag enabled (thanks to Klaus Spanderen and to Jon Davies for the heads-up).</li>

<p >MATH</p><ul>
<li>Fixed bug in convex-monotone interpolation (thanks to Peter Caspers for the fix and to Tom Anderson for finding the bug).</li>
</ul>
<p >NEW OPT-IN FEATURES</p><ul>
<li>It is now possible to use <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and its related classes instead of <code>boost::shared_ptr</code>. Note that, unlike its boost counterpart, <code>std::shared_ptr</code> doesn't check for null pointers before access; this can lead to crashes. The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the <code>QL_USE_STD_SHARED_PTR</code> macro in <code>ql/userconfig.hpp</code> on Visual C++ or by passing the <code>--enable-std-pointers</code> to <code>./configure</code> on other systems. This requires using at least the C++11 standard during compilation.</li>
<li>It is now possible to use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead of <code>std::auto_ptr</code>; this makes it possible to compile the library in strict C++17 mode and to avoid deprecation warnings in C++11 and C++14 mode. The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the <code>QL_USE_STD_UNIQUE_PTR</code> macro in <code>ql/userconfig.hpp</code> on Visual C++ or by passing the <code>--enable-std-unique-ptr</code> to <code>./configure</code> on other systems.</li>

<p ><b>Release 1.4.1 - November 17th, 2014</b></p>
<p >QuantLib 1.4.1 is a compatibility release. It fixes a number of compilation errors that surfaced when using QuantLib 1.4 with Clang 3.5 and Boost 1.57. Thanks to Tim Smith for the heads-up.</p>
<p >If you are not using Clang, you don't need to upgrade from QuantLib 1.4 to 1.4.1.</p>
<p ><b>Release 1.4 - February 26th, 2014</b></p>
<p >PORTABILITY</p><ul>
<li>Boost 1.39 or later is now required. We felt this could be enforced without causing grief to virtually anyone, given that 1.39 was released back in May 2009. We don't expect many people being stuck with an earlier version. This allows one to use make_shared to create shared_ptr instances, which has a number of advantages. Unfortunately, the C++03 implementation (which is still used by a number of older compiler that we're supporting) only allows a maximum of 9 constructor arguments, so we won't be able to use it everywhere.</li>
<li>Support for Visual C++ 2003 (VC++7) was dropped. The compiler is now more than 10 years old and no longer supported by Microsoft. Keeping the support is not worth the time and effort required. Anybody who is still stuck with this compiler and needs the support can fork the repository and maintain the changes.</li>
<li>Specific support for Visual C++ 2013 (VC++12) is not yet available; however, version checks in the code were relaxed so that one can import and convert the VC++11 solution without causing errors when auto-linking the generated libraries.</li>
<li>Fixed Clang warnings.</li>
<li>Use deprecated attribute of supported compilers. This replaces the QL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED mechanism that conditionally removes the features and causes the compiler itself to emit warnings if the features are used. The user can enable or disable the warnings by the means provided by the compiler.</li>
<li>Allow singletons to work under Visual C++ when CLR is enabled (thanks to Simon Shakeshaft).</li>
<li>Fixed compilation errors when using STLport (thanks to Marcello Pietrobon for the heads-up).</li>
</ul>
<p >CONFIGURATION</p><ul>
<li>Added switch to enable OpenMP-based parallelism (thanks to Joseph Wang). Currently, this is only used in a few loops in the finite-differences and tree frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p >DATE/TIME</p><ul>
<li>Added Diamond Jubilee bank holiday to UK calendar.</li>
<li>Added Royal Wedding bank holiday to UK calendar (thanks to Whit Armstrong for the heads-up).</li>
<li>Added utilities to parse and format a date with the extended format implemented in Boost.Date (thanks to Michael von den Driesch). The previous parsing utility was deprecated.</li>
<li>Added Actual/365 (No Leap) day counter (thanks to Nick Glass).</li>
<li>Updated most moving holidays for 2014.</li>
<li>Fixed a Schedule bug where a combination of backwards generation and end-of-month convention would result in missing or duplicated dates (thanks to Nicholas Manganaro for the heads-up).</li>
