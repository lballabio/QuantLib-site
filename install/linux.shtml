<h2>Boost Installation</h2>

<p>If you don't require a particular Boost version, the path of least
resistance is to install the one packaged for your distribution; for
instance, on Ubuntu you would execute:</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
</pre>
<p>while on Fedora the above would be:</p>
<pre>
  sudo yum install boost-devel
</pre>

<p>Using a packaged distribution has the additional upside of
installing Boost in a default location where the compiler can find
it. If you can, go for it and skip the rest of this section.</p>

<p>If, instead, you want a particular version of Boost, or if you
don't have administrative rights on your machine, you'll have to
compile Boost yourself. Instructions for that are available on the
Boost site
at <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html">http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html</a>. In
this case, you might end up with a Boost installation in a
non-standard location; take a note of it, as you'll need it later.</p>

<h2>QuantLib Installation</h2>

<h3>Installation from package repositories</h3>

<p>If you don't need to modify the library, you might want to skip the
compilation and install a precompiled binary version; unofficial RPM
and DEB packages should be available for your distribution through the
usual channels.  Note that the default version on Debian and Ubuntu
distributions might be lagging behind; to get a recent one, use the
"unstable" (a.k.a. "Sid") distribution on Debian
or <a href="https://launchpad.net/~edd/+archive/ubuntu/misc">Dirk
Eddelbuettel's PPA</a> on Ubuntu.</p>

<p>If you want to modify the library, instead, you'll have to compile
it yourself as described in the next section.</p>

<h3>Installation from a released version</h3>

<p>You can download released QuantLib versions from GitHub
at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/releases">https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/releases</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have the tarball, extract it by executing:</p>
<pre>
tar xzf QuantLib-1.4.1.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>(1.4.1 is the most recent version at the time of this writing; you
might have downloaded another one.) This creates a
folder <code>QuantLib-1.4.1</code>; enter it and configure QuantLib by
executing:</p>
<pre>
  cd QuantLib-1.4.1
  ./configure
</pre>

<p>The above step is customizable, if you want: run</p>
<pre>
  ./configure --help
</pre>
<p>to obtain a list of the configuration options. In particular,
the <code>--prefix</code> option can be used to install QuantLib in a
location other than the default (<code>/usr/local</code>).</p>

<p>This is also the step where you might have to
tell <code>configure</code> about the location of your Boost
installation, if that's not a standard one. If, for instance, you
installed the Boost headers in <code>/home/foo/include</code>
and the libraries in <code>/home/foo/lib</code>, execute:</p>
<pre>
  ./configure --with-boost-include=/home/foo/include --with-boost-lib=/home/foo/lib
</pre>
<p>to setup the build correctly. Finally,</p>
<pre>
  make
</pre>
<p>builds the library and</p>
<pre>
  sudo make install
</pre>
<p>installs it (if you specified a location with <code>--prefix</code> that doesn't need admin permissions, you won't need to use <code>sudo</code> before <code>make install</code>). Depending on your system, you might also need to run</p>
<pre>
  sudo ldconfig
</pre>
<p>to notify the dynamic linker that a new shared library is available.
(The above works with the default prefix, <code>/usr/local</code>, on
most system; if you chose another one, or if your programs still can't
find <code>libQuantLib.so</code>, you'll need to add the location of
the library to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> before
running <code>ldconfig</code>.  For a default installation, that
would be <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.)</p>

<p>Once you're done, you can try to compile and run an example to check your
installation. If you installed everything in the default location, you
can simply execute:</p>
<pre>
  cd Examples/BermudanSwaption
  g++ BermudanSwaption.cpp -o BermudanSwaption -lQuantLib
  ./BermudanSwaption
</pre>
<p>Otherwise, you'll have to specify the location of your Boost and
QuantLib installations with corresponding <code>-I</code>
and <code>-L</code> flags; for instance, the middle step above would be:</p>
<pre>
  g++ BermudanSwaption.cpp -I/home/foo/include -o BermudanSwaption -L/home/foo/lib -lQuantLib
</pre>
<p>if you ran <code>./configure</code> with prefix <code>/home/foo</code>.</p>

<h3>Installation from a git repository</h3>

<p>If you want to compile from a checkout of a git repository (such as
the official one
at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib">https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib</a>,
or a fork of it that you might have created) you'll need an additional
step at the beginning of the process. Before running
the <code>./configure</code> script, you'll have to create it by
executing</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>To do this, you'll need automake, autoconf and libtool. Again,
they're packaged for most Linux distributions; on Ubuntu, you would
get them by running</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool
</pre>
<p>After the execution of <code>./autogen.sh</code>, the installation proceeds
as in the previous section.</p>
