<h1 class="center">QuantLib-Python installation on Linux</h1>

<h2>Installation from PyPI (recommended)</h2>

<p>If you don't need to modify the wrappers, you can install a
precompiled wheel from PyPI.  Once you have activated the Python
environment you want to use, make sure you have the latest version
of <code>pip</code> by running:</p>
<pre>
  python -m pip install -U pip
</pre>
<p>(note that your Python interpreter might be named <code>python3</code> instead) and then run:</p>
<pre>
  python -m pip install QuantLib
</pre>
<p>If a wheel is available for your system (which is likely)
it will be installed and you will be able to leave this page and use
it right away; if not, you'll have to compile it yourself as described
in the next section.</p>

<h2>Installation from a released version</h2>

<p>The following assumes that you already installed
QuantLib; instructions are available
at <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/install/linux.shtml">https://www.quantlib.org/install/linux.shtml</a></p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Before compiling the wrappers, you'll need to set up an appropriate
environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the commands you'll run will need to
    invoke <code>quantlib-config</code> (which was installed with
    QuantLib) to find out what flags should be passed to the compiler
    and linker; they will also include the additional include
    directories you might have specified when you built QuantLib, so
    you'll be covered even if you have, say, Boost in a non-standard
    place. This means that you must ensure
    that <code>quantlib-config</code> is in your executable path.</li>
  <li>You'll need to install a few Python modules.  It's good practice
    to install them in a new virtual environment, to avoid possible
    conflicts with your system Python installation.  This also helps
    in case you have multiple versions of Python on your machine.  You
    can create the virtual environment with
<pre>
  python3 -m venv .venv
</pre>
    and activate it with
<pre>
  . .venv/bin/activate
</pre>
    (mind the single dot at the beginning of the line.)  Once the
    environment is active, run
<pre>
  pip install setuptools build tox pytest
</pre>
    If you're using <code>conda</code> to manage your environments,
    you know what to do instead.
  </li>
  <li>You'll also need the Python development files installed (that
    is, <code>python.h</code> and so on). They might be available by
    default; but if not, you'll have to figure out how to get them. On
    Ubuntu, for instance, you would install them with:
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install python3-dev
</pre>
    Similar packages should be available for most other
    distributions.</li>
  <li>Contrary to popular belief, working from a released
    tarball <strong>doesn't require you to have SWIG
    installed</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compilation</h3>

<p>You can download released QuantLib-SWIG versions from GitHub
  at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/releases">https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/releases</a>.
  You should download the same version as the version of QuantLib you
  installed; for the sake of example, I'll use version 1.36 which is
  the most recent version at the time of this writing.
</p>

<p>Once you have the tarball, extract it by executing</p>
<pre>
  tar xzf QuantLib-SWIG-1.36.tar.gz
</pre>
This creates a folder <code>QuantLib-SWIG-1.36</code>;
enter it and configure QuantLib by executing:
<pre>
  cd QuantLib-SWIG-1.36
  ./configure
</pre>

<p>After configuration, you can run
<pre>
  cd Python
  make
</pre>
<p>This will create a binary wheel in the <code>dist</code> directory.
To check that it works, run</p>
<pre>
  make check
</pre>
<p>from the <code>Python</code> directory (you should already be there).</p>

<p>Once you're done, you can take the wheel and install it
with <code>pip</code> in the environment of your choice.</p>


<h2>Installation from a git repository</h2>

<p>If you want to compile from a checkout of a git repository (such as
the official one
at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib-swig">https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib-swig</a>,
or a fork of it that you might have created) you'll need an additional
step at the beginning of the process. Before running
the <code>./configure</code> script, you'll have to create it by
executing</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>To do this, you'll need automake, autoconf and libtool. Again,
they're packaged for most Linux distributions; on Ubuntu, you would
get them by running</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool
</pre>
<p>After the execution of <code>./autogen.sh</code>, the installation
proceeds as in the previous section. Note, though, that in this case
you'll need SWIG available; you can download and install it
from <a href="http://swig.org">http://swig.org</a>. At the time of
this writing, the wrappers use SWIG 4.3.0.</p>
